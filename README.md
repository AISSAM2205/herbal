## Introduction

Alternative medicine, also known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), includes a variety of therapeutic and pseudo-therapeutic practices that are not part of conventional medicine. Although the effectiveness of these practices is not scientifically proven, they are often used alongside conventional treatments to help individuals achieve better personal balance. The World Health Organization officially recognizes acupuncture, homeopathy, mesotherapy, and osteopathy among the numerous alternative practices available.

This project aims to create a platform where users can consult, garden, or purchase medicinal plants.

## Project Description

### General Idea

The project aims to develop an innovative website centered around medicinal plants. This portal will offer a wide selection of plants known for their healing properties, helping visitors find natural solutions for various ailments. Besides online sales, the site will provide personalized consultations with phytotherapy professionals to guide clients in the appropriate use of medicinal plants. The goal is to promote a holistic approach to health, combining the benefits of plant remedies with expert advice to meet the specific needs of each individual.

### Site Description

Our site comprises five navigation pages: Home, Shop, About, FAQ, and Login. Each page has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, as necessary.

#### Home Page
The home page explains the site's functionality and includes a "Sign Up" button that navigates to an independent registration page.

#### Shop Page
This page is dedicated to showcasing our medicinal plants to customers.

#### About Page
This page provides more information to the user about our mission and offerings.

#### FAQ Page
This page answers the most frequently asked questions by users during consultations.

#### Login Page
The login page allows users to create an account on our site.

## Architecture

### Development Environment

We used Visual Studio Code as our text editor. The front-end technologies include:
1. **HTML:** A universal, simple, effective, and extensible standard language.
2. **CSS:** A responsive design language, easy to implement.
3. **JavaScript:** Known for its interactivity, dynamism, ecosystem, and library support.

For the back-end, we used **Node.js** due to its fast execution based on Google's V8 engine, non-blocking architecture, and asynchronous I/O model, which handles numerous simultaneous connections with minimal latency.

### File Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

1. **README.md:** A startup guide summarizing the necessary steps to activate the site and troubleshoot technical issues.
2. **HTML Source Codes:**
    - `index.html`: Home page
    - `about.html`: About page
    - `faq.html`: FAQ page
    - `signup.html`: Sign-Up page
    - `shop.html`: Shop page
    - `login.html`: Login page
3. **Database:** Contains the data required for the site.
4. **Package:** 
    - `package.json` is used to manage dependencies, scripts, and site configurations. More details are provided in README.md.
5. **Assets:**
    - **Images:** Contains images used on the site.
    - **Scripts:** Contains JS codes for login, sign-up, and shop pages.
    - **Styles:** Contains CSS codes used across the site.
6. **Backend:** 
    - A backend server using Express, managing a SQLite database to store information about herbs.
    - A package file configuring all dependencies and scripts necessary for managing the Node.js application, facilitating development and deployment.
